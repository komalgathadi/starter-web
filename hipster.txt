What is this site?

We continuously monitor the status of github.com and all its related services. If there are any interruptions in service, a note will be posted here.

What are these graphs?

These graphs are sampled periodically from our own internal metrics about the performance and availability of GitHub services. They’re accurate to within a few minutes.

We provide a GitHub Site Status API for consuming this information. If you're a service that integrates with GitHub, you can use these JSON responses to populate your own status dashboard.
